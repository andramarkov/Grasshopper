# Grasshopper :: Game Engine

* Public Trello board for [features and ongoing development](https://trello.com/b/7Nd9pp9O/grasshopper)
* Github issues for [reporting bugs and asking questions]

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. SERIOUSLY. PRE-PRE-PRE-ALPHA.**

Grasshopper is a code-first game engine written entirely in C# and .Net. There
are various commercial game engines out there that have extremely negligible
licensing costs, so it is not my aim to make any money from this, but rather I am
"scratching my own itch", so to speak. My motivations for doing this are below.

### Goals

* I want to work on my various game ideas in a coding environment I am both
  comfortable with and productive in.
* I want to learn, and get extremely good at, 3D game programming. The engine is
  named as such because I "have much to learn, grasshopper", in this regard. I
  will be applying my general software engineering experience to build
  the best architecture I can, employing good software engineering principles.
* I want to to approach game development from a minimal, code-first perspective.
  Just a few lines of code should be all I need to start making things happen.
* I want an engine that I know the codebase of from top to bottom, am able to
  extend and improve as much as I like, and which doesn't stand in my way when
  I have an idea I'd like to implement.
* I want an engine which is designed in such a way that it facilitates, rather
  than hinders, procedural content generation. Techniques and algorithms that
  favour pre-baked content are likely to be deprioritised in this regard.
  I would like almost all relevant engine components, from materials, to animations,
  to 3D models, to textures, to be able to be constructed and made use of at run-
  time if desired. I want the process of generating, streaming, loading and unloading
  content to be extremely easy and work without interrupting the user experience.
* Even though the engine is first and foremost for my own needs, I'd like it to
  be well-documented with a full set of XML code comments, extensive samples
  that demonstrate how to use the engine from absolute first principles, without
  overwhelming other people who may be interested in using it.

### Samples

Some exist (see the samples folder). I'll list them here later, when I've implemented more of the core engine.

There is no "release date" or ETA on the completion of anything on my to-do list.
It's done when it's done, and that's entirely based on when I choose to work on it.
