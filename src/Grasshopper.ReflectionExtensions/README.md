# Grasshopper :: Game Engine

This project contains time-saving extensions and classes that can be used when
running in a full reflection-enabled environment. Typically this means desktop
environments running the .NET framework; Windows for .NET 4.5 and also OS X and
Linux for .NET 5.x and beyond. Compilation targets such as iOS do not support
most reflection features and thus cannot use these features.
