## Note about procedural generation and custom vertex formats

When generating procedural meshes, we could be using any combination of
different vertex elements depending on our needs. A generic procedural
generator can't know in advance what our vertex requirements are, and must
therefore generate an intermediate object which we can convert to our custom
vertex format. The intermediate object will contain all the information that
we might want about each vertex, and we can select the elements we want when
we perform the conversion to our preferred vertex format.
