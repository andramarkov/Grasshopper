FlappyCraft: Simple 3D game inspired by Flappy Bird, but in a 3D field with Minecraft-inspired tile graphics

Overview
- Camera goes behind the player rather than beside
- The map is composed of a grid of random-height tiles, like large Minecraft-style blocks, which the player must fly over and avoid hitting
- Some tiles are tree trunks, which forces the player to change direction sometimes
- Overhead is a canopy of Minecraft-style branches and leaves which must also be avoided
- Clicking on the map causes a "flap", and also makes the player change to face that direction
- Points gained are equal to the sum of the X and Y distances from the origin that the player has travelled so far
- We get a 2D HUD at the top of the page showing the height field in the direction that the player is currently facing

Entity system
- 
- player
	- chicken model
- camera


- we can procedurally generate everything on-the-fly; a grid is not really needed
- texturing is not initially required; can add it later
- player can initially be represented by a box and replaced later with a chicken
- three game states
	1. start screen ("click to begin")
	2. playing
	3. game over

Getting Started
- first thing to do is be able to generate a procedural landscape
	- use a random seed
	- use the RNG from the old worldgarden code (put it into Grasshopper.Procedural)
	- use a simple 2D array and rebuild it when transitioning to a new grid location
